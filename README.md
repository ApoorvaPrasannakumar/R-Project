•  user_age - the age of the user in years
•  demo_source - how the user initially discovered the software
•  data_rows_input - how many rows of their own data the user uploaded to the software
•  users_in_network - how many people the user knows who already use the software
•  outreach_emails_sent - the number of emails sent to the user by the software company while the user is in the demo period
•  support_tickets_filed - the number of support requests sent by the user to the software company while using the demo
•  converted - boolean label of whether the user converted and purchased the software.
