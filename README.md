# R-Project

Description of project:

The data set used in this project is about demo of a product .Each row in this dataset contains information about a person who signed up for a demo of a software product. The objective is to build a model to predict whether or not a given user will "convert" and purchase the software.This project aims to analyze following concepts using R analysis. 
1.	Which demo source is better? Email or website?
2.	Total minutes spent on email demo is more or on website?
3.	User age of email demo source v/s website demo source user age
4.	For user who checked demo software sent through email weather total minutes spent on demo software is a significant factor in predicting whether or not that user converted the software?
5.	For user who checked demo software on website weather total minutes spent on demo software is a significant factor in predicting whether or not that user converted the software?
6.	For user who checked demo software sent through email weather age group is a significant factor in predicting whether or not that user converted the software?
7.	For user who checked demo software sent through email weather age group is a significant factor in predicting whether or not that user converted the software?
